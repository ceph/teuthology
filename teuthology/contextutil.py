class safe_while(object):
    """
    A context manager to remove boiler plate code that deals with `while` loops
    that need a given number of tries and some seconds to sleep between each
    one of those tries.

    The most simple example possible will try 10 times sleeping for 6 seconds:

        >>> from teuthology.contexutil import safe_while
        >>> with safe_while() as proceed:
        ...    while proceed():
        ...        # repetitive code here
        ...        print("hello world")
        ...
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        MaxWhileTries: reached maximum tries (5) after waiting for 75 seconds

    Yes, this adds yet another level of indentation but it allows you to
    implement while loops exactly the same as before with just 1 more
    indentation level and one extra call. Everything else stays the same,
    code-wise. So adding this helper to existing code is simpler.

    :param sleep:     The amount of time to sleep between tries. Default 6
    :param increment: The amount to add to the sleep value on each try.
                      Default 0.
    :param tries:     The amount of tries before giving up. Default 10.
    :param action:    The name of the action being attempted. Default none.
    :param _raise:    Whether to raise an exception (or log a warning).
                      Default True.
    :param _sleeper:  The function to use to sleep. Only used for testing.
                      Default time.sleep
