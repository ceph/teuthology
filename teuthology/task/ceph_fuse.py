    Mount/unmount a ``ceph-fuse`` client.

    The config is optional and defaults to mounting on all clients. If
    a config is given, it is expected to be a list of clients to do
    this operation on. This lets you e.g. set up one client with
    ``ceph-fuse`` and another with ``kclient``.

    Example that mounts all clients::

        tasks:
        - ceph:
        - ceph-fuse:
        - interactive:

    Example that uses both ``kclient` and ``ceph-fuse``::

        tasks:
        - ceph:
        - ceph-fuse: [client.0]
        - kclient: [client.1]
        - interactive:

    Example that enables valgrind:

        tasks:
        - ceph:
        - ceph-fuse:
            client.0:
              valgrind: [--tool=memcheck, --leak-check=full, --show-reachable=yes]
        - interactive:

    Example that stops an already-mounted client:

    ::

        tasks:
            - ceph:
            - ceph-fuse: [client.0]
