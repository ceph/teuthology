Site and Client Configuration
=============================

Teuthology requires several configuration options to be set, and provides many other optional ones. They are looked for in ``~/.teuthology.yaml`` if it exists, or ``/etc/teuthology.yaml`` if it doesn't.

Here is a sample configuration with many of the options set and documented::

    # lab_domain: the domain name to append to all short hostnames
    lab_domain: example.com

    # If true the hostname of the targets are canonicalized using an
    # algorithm specific to the Ceph community lab. If false the
    # targets hostname are left untouched.
    # This is enabled by default.
    canonicalize_hostname: true

    # The root directory to use for storage of all scheduled job logs and 
    # other data.
    archive_base: /home/teuthworker/archive

    # The default machine_type value to use when not specified. Currently 
    # only used by teuthology-suite.
    default_machine_type: awesomebox

    # Control how many machines need to be free in the cluster. 0 means
    # Teuthology can use the entire cluster.
    reserve_machines: 5

    # The host and port to use for the beanstalkd queue. This is required 
    # for scheduled jobs.
    queue_host: localhost
    queue_port: 11300

    # The URL of the lock server (paddles). This is required for scheduled 
    # jobs.
    lock_server: http://paddles.example.com:8080/

    # The URL of the results server (paddles).
    results_server: http://paddles.example.com:8080/

    # This URL of the results UI server (pulpito). You must of course use 
    # paddles for pulpito to be useful.
    results_ui_server: http://pulpito.example.com/

    # Email address that will receive job results summaries.
    results_email: ceph-qa@example.com

    # Email address that job results summaries originate from
    results_sending_email: teuthology@example.com

    # How long (in seconds) teuthology-results should wait for jobs to finish
    # before considering them 'hung'
    results_timeout: 43200

    # Gitbuilder archive that stores e.g. ceph packages
    gitbuilder_host: gitbuilder.example.com

    # Where all git repos are considered to reside.
    ceph_git_base_url: https://github.com/ceph/

    # Where teuthology and ceph-qa-suite repos should be stored locally
    src_base_path: /home/foo/src

    # Whether or not teuthology-suite, when scheduling, should update 
    # itself from git. This is disabled by default.
    automated_scheduling: false

    # How often, in seconds, teuthology-worker should poll its child job 
    # processes
    watchdog_interval: 120

    # How long a scheduled job should be allowed to run, in seconds, before 
    # it is killed by the worker process.
    max_job_time: 259200

    # The template from which the URL of the repository containing packages
    # is built.
    #
    # {host} is 'gitbuilder_host' from .teuthology.yaml
    # {proj} is the value of 'project' from the job yaml file or 'ceph'
    # {flavor} is the value of 'flavor' from the job yaml file or 'basic'
    # {uri} is ref/tag if 'tag' is set in the job yaml file
    #       or ref/branch if 'branch' is set in the job yaml file
    #       or sha1/sha1 if 'sha1' is set in the job yaml file
    #       or ref/master
    # {pkg_type} is either 'deb' or 'rpm' depending on the host on which the
    #            packages are to be installed
    # {dist} If lsb_release -si is Fedora the value is:
    #          Fedora 20 => fc20
    #          Fedora 21 => fc21
    #          etc.
    #        If lsb_release -si is CentOS or RedHatEnterpriseServer it is
    #          CentOS 6.5 => centos6
    #          CentOS 7.0 => centos7
    #          CentOS 7.1 => centos7
    #          RedHatEnterpriseServer 6.4 => centos6
    #          RedHatEnterpriseServer 7.0 => centos7
    #          RedHatEnterpriseServer 7.1 => centos7
    #          etc.
    #       Everything else is whatever lsb_release -sc returns
    #          Ubuntu 12.04 => precise
    #          Ubuntu 14.04 => trusty
    #          Debian GNU/Linux 7.0 => wheezy
    #          Debian GNU/Linux 8.0 => jessie
    #          etc.
    # {arch} is the output of the 'arch' command on the host on which
    #        the packages are to be installed
    #           i386
    #           x86_64
    #           armv7l
    #           etc.
